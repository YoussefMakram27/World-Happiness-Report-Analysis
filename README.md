🌍 World Happiness Report Analysis
📌 Overview
This project explores the World Happiness Report dataset, using data science techniques to analyze trends in global happiness. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering to uncover meaningful insights.

🔍 Key Steps
✔ Data Cleaning & Imputation

Handled missing values using IterativeImputer (features are correlated, so missing values were predicted based on other features).
✔ Outlier Detection & Handling

Plotted histograms & box plots to assess distributions.
Applied IQR method to handle skewed outliers.
✔ Feature Scaling

Used MinMaxScaler to normalize feature values.
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Plotted heatmaps to analyze feature correlations.
Created a Happiness Score based on the weights of key factors.
✔ Data Visualization
📊 Top 30 happiest countries
📈 Happiness trends over the years

🛠 Technologies Used
pandas, numpy (Data Processing)
sklearn (Imputation, Scaling)
plotly (Interactive Visualizations)
